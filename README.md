I have successfully developed a currency converter application utilizing a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To ensure accurate and up-to-date currency exchange rates, I integrated an API for real-time data retrieval. The application provides users with a seamless experience, allowing them to input an amount and receive instant conversions based on the current exchange rates.
